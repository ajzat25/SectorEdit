# SectorEdit
SectorEdit is A CPU accelerated First Person 3D Graphics Engine in Golang.
## Tell Me More
SectorEdit uses optimisations similar to the techniques used some older game engines, like Doom, Quake, Build, and GoldSource. It works in OpenGL 2.1 immediate mode, and uses the fixed function pipeline. However, I am considering switching to the programmable pipeline.
### Dependencies
